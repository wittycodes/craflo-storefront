**Catalyst** is [Reaction Commerce](https://www.reactioncommerce.com/)'s design system that we use to build Reaction's Admin interface. Catalyst components are used for Reaction Admin and any future operator user interfaces we may build. The Catalyst components are focused on the user experience for operators and will help consistency across the Reaction Admin. Additionally, Catalyst will make it easier to build and update new user interfaces in the future.

** Note, Catalyst is a work in progress **

Consistent with our principles of work we've made Catalyst public early in its development. That means that we do not have all the components needed to build for Reaction Admin. Conversely, not all of Reaction Admin has been converted to using Catalyst. With each release we plan to add more components, more documentation and convert more of Reaction Admin to Catalyst.

#### Guiding design principles

- **Design for the user.**
    - Reaction Commerce should feel easy to use on a daily basis. Our design should be empathetic and encourage new ideas in commerce.
- **Be simple, not boring.**
    - Our design is considered, useful, and aesthetic. In our design decisions, we want to attain consistency and beauty.
- **Easy to start, easy to grow.**
    - Be welcoming while progressively revealing the complexity under the hood.
- **Always be forward thinking.**
    - Design and architect for the future. Design flexible, customizable, modular, and extendable flows that will contribute to the overall system.

#### Who is it for?

##### Designers

Catalyst is a tool for Reaction designers to both maintain consistency and facilitate ease of communication with developers. 

##### Developers

Catalyst is a tool for Reaction developers for speed and consistency when building user interfaces for Reaction Admin. Catalyst also operates as a manual for user experience and consistent client side development patterns that will reduce technical and design debt. 

##### Open source

Catalyst is open source and allows for designers and developers in the community to build Reaction Admin plugins in order to extend and customize their store's capabilities. Additionally, Catalyst makes it easier for Reaction's open source community to make contributions by providing user interface components to build plugins consistent to Reaction Admin.
