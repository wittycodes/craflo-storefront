## Component
Description of the issue this component this PR adds. Also include, as necessary:
- Any other components this component requires
- Any NPM dependencies added

## Breaking changes
You should almost never include "BREAKING CHANGES" because weâ€™re duplicating components to avoid that. Consult with others before doing it.

## Testing
1. List the steps needed for testing your change in this section.
2. Assume that testers already know how to start the app, and do the basic setup tasks.
3. Be detailed enough that someone can work through it without being too granular

More detail for what each of these sections should include are available in our [Contributing Docs](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/contributing-to-reaction)
