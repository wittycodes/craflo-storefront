# This docker-compose file is used to run the project in Docker for development.
# The local files are mounted into the created container.

# Usage:
#  ln -s docker-compose.dev.yml docker-compose.override.yml
#  docker-compose up [-d]

# To go back to running the published image:
#  rm docker-compose.override.yml

    # The main `docker-compose.yml` has an `image` prop. Unfortunately, when we
    # add `build` prop here, it changes the meaning of that `image` prop to
    # "tag the built image with this image name". This has the effect of breaking
    # the app after you've run with the override and then go back to running without
    # it, because now `reactioncommerce/admin:trunk` would actually be your dev image.
    # To work around this issue, we specify a different tag name here, which does not
    # match any of our published tags.
