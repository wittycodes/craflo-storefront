# Contributing

We're thrilled that you want to contribute to the Reaction Component Library!

Before submitting your first contribution, please consult the [official guide on contributing to the Reaction code base](https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/docs/contributing-to-reaction) first. The sections below are currently specific to the Reaction Component Library and should be considered in addition to the official guide.

# Signing your Commits

Contributing to the Reaction Component Library requires signing your work by way of signed Git commits.

The Reaction Component Library uses the Apache 2.0 license to allow our community and customers to use it in whichever way they please. It also helps foster open contributions.

As a contributor, we want to make sure that you understand your rights as the copyright holder. We also want to make sure that contributions done on behalf of companies (i.e. by their employees) are submitted with the acknowledgement that the contributor (employee) isn't the copyright holder (employer).

The Reaction Components Library is using a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), by way of signed commits, to help contributors acknowledge that they're aware of their rights, and that they have the authority to submit their contributions either on their or on their employer's behalf.

To sign off on the DCO for your commits, use the command `git commit -s` which adds a line to every commit that looks like this:

`Signed-Off-By: Jane Doe <jane@example.com>`

We do ask that you use your full name and a valid email address in this process.

The DCO signoff is attached to every single commit, thereby stating that the committer agrees to the DCO as shown below or on <https://developercertificate.org/>.

```

    submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole
    or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless
    I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
    Indicated in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified

    sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed
    consistent with this project or the open source license(s)
    involved.
